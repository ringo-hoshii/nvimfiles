-- some changes blah blah blah
--
-- some changes again
-- and some more
-- i actually don't know what's better:
-- <leader>W or <leader>e for saving and quitting
--
-- bootstrap lazy.nvim, LazyVim and your plugins
-- require("config.lazy")

require("keymaps")
require("opts")
require("plugins")

-- so when im just writing it actually kinda looks weird because of this waiting "animation"
-- fuck why is it so fucking satisfying now?!
-- im becoming more addictive

-- [5/11/2025 14:30] um, I'm not quite sure what I was talking about
-- but I meant addicted*

-- [8/4/2025 15:37] and now it makes even less sense after I split up
-- the config :p
-- I don't even remember what the context was. was it about
-- mini.animations? because that's the only thing I can think of
